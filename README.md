# WebDev-Final-Front

This project is inspired by many applications that give gamers information of their matches on games like [League of Legends](https://zeit.co/),
[Dota 2](http://blog.dota2.com/) and [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/). 
The objective of the application is to provide a place for players to create builds for their champions and share them among other players.
As well as set some of their champions as favorites.

This application was created by [Nissim Betesh](https://github.com/NissimBet) and [Carlos Tamez](https://github.com/CyberFroppy)
